# Transport-Live-Video-to-Web
In the local area, there is a IP Camera and we aim to live broadcast on our web page. For this purpose we need to transport these frames coming from IP Camera to web server on some way. And we have a two different solution to solve this problem:
- The first one is transport a frame that coming from IP Camera to our web server on FTP directly .
- Second way is store a frame that coming from IP Camera to MongoDB database which is located on server.
